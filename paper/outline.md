# Paper Outline

1. Introduction
	- Graph Algorithms (Page Rank, Clustering etc.)
	- Infeasible for big graphs 
	- Solution: Reduce the graph size, run algorithm, translate result to the full graph.
	- Open question: How does this affect the result quality?
2. Graph Laplacians
	- Perspective: Graph as a linear operator (i.e. its adjacency matrix). Similar to heat flow.
	- Tool to understand heat flow: Laplacian. Give intuition. Maybe compare to continuous Laplacian from Physics?
3. Graph Coarsening
	1. Coarsening matrices
	2. REC Algorithm: Randomized Edge Contraction
4. Spectral Graph Similarity
	1. SS
	2. RSS
	3. Evaluation of REC via RSS
5. Conclusion
