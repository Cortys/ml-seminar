\section{Effects of Coarsening}%
\label{sec:cons}

We have just seen how to compute a coarsened graph $G_c$ via the REC algorithm.
What remains to be answered now is how coarsening affects the performance of graph algorithms when $G_c$ is used as a proxy for the original graph $G$.
In the first step we will introduce a graph similarity measure.
Using this measure we will then put bounds on the dissimilarity of $G$ and $G_c$.
Finally we will use those bounds to analyze the influence of coarsening on the performance of the \textit{spectral clustering algorithm}.
