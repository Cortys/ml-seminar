\begin{abstract}%
	This paper describes how coarsening affects the spectrum of a graph.
	For this the notion of restricted spectral similarity is introduced.
	This similarity measure compares graphs via the distance between their Laplacian's eigenvalues.
	The measure is used to show that the spectral distortion introduced by coarsening is smallest for regular graphs.
