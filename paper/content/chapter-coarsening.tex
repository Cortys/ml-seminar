\section{Graph Coarsening}%
\label{sec:coarse}

We will now see how the size of a graph $G$ can be reduced via \textit{graph coarsening}.
The resulting coarsened graph $G_c$ should ideally be structurally similar to $G$, i.e.\@ it should have a similar spectrum.
In this section we will first define the class of coarsening operators $C$ formally and give an intuition how they change the shape of a graph.
Then we will describe a randomized algorithm to compute such a coarsening.
